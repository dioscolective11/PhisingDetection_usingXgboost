## Definition of Phishing
Phishing is a cyberattack method where attackers impersonate legitimate entities (e.g., banks, companies, or government agencies) to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers. These attacks are typically carried out via email, text messages, or malicious websites.

 ## Overview of Detection Methods
Phishing detection systems employ various methods to identify and mitigate phishing threats. These methods can be broadly categorized into:
![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/aqua.png)

 ## URL Analysis: Checking the legitimacy of URLs against known phishing sites.
Content Analysis: Analyzing the content of emails and messages for suspicious patterns or keywords.
User Behavior Analysis: Monitoring user behavior to identify anomalies that may indicate phishing attempts.
Role of Machine Learning in Phishing Detection
Machine learning (ML) plays a crucial role in modern phishing detection systems. By training algorithms on large datasets of phishing and legitimate URLs, ML models can learn to identify patterns and characteristics associated with phishing attempts. Common ML techniques used include:

 ## Supervised Learning: Training models on labeled datasets to classify URLs or emails as phishing or legitimate.
Unsupervised Learning: Identifying anomalies in user behavior or email patterns without labeled data.
Key Features Used in Detection
Phishing detection systems often rely on a variety of features to assess the likelihood of a phishing attempt. Some common features include:

## URL Length: Phishing URLs are often longer than legitimate ones.
Domain Age: Newly registered domains are more likely to be used for phishing.
Presence of HTTPS: While HTTPS is a positive indicator, many phishing sites now use it to appear legitimate.
Number of Subdomains: Phishing URLs may contain multiple subdomains to confuse users.
6. Implementation of a Phishing Detection System
Data Collection and Preprocessing
The first step in building a phishing detection system is collecting data. This can include datasets of known phishing and legitimate URLs, email content, and user behavior logs. Preprocessing involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming features for analysis.

 ## üîç Key Highlights:

Hybrid Model ‚Äì Sequential + Handcrafted Features
Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is a critical step where relevant features are derived from the raw data. For URLs, features might include length, number of digits, presence of special characters, and more. For emails, features could include the sender's address, subject line, and body content.

Model Training and Evaluation
Once features are extracted, machine learning models can be trained using labeled datasets. Common algorithms include:

Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
XGBoost: A gradient boosting framework that is effective for classification tasks.
LightGBM: A fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework.
After training, models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their performance.

Visualization and Interpretation of Results
Visualizations, such as confusion matrices and feature importance plots, help interpret model performance and understand which features contribute most to predictions. This step is crucial for refining the model and improving its accuracy.
